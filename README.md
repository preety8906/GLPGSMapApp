Features:

● Realtime Running Tracking App. Starts tracking automatically when the app starts.

● Using GPS

● Show running path in a map with a red line.

● Show average speed and refresh the information every 10 seconds.

● Current location should be shown with a red circle.




Important Note:

Please comment "DEBUG_MODE_ON" in Constants.h file when running the app on device. When using the GPX file on simulator, the code to manually stop the tracking once reached the destination is written in "DEBUG_MODE_ON" flag. Otherwise, the GPX file restarts the tracking once destination is reached. This issue will not come when running on the device.
